# flight-planner

**This is not a certified software tool**

The goal of this project is to automatically create optimal flight plans, given departure and arrival airports and constraints (such as airspace restrictions, NOTAMs, etc.)

Currently the project is a set of python scripts, however, the long term vision is to make this a web application.
